A mentall illness, also called mental health disorders, refers to a wide range of mentall health conditions that affect a person's thinking, mood, behavior, or overall functioning. These conditions involve disturbances in thoughts, emotions, or behaviors that cause significant distress or impairment in personal, social, occupational, or other important areas of life.

Mentall illness can include disorders such as depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorders, and many others. They are medical conditions that can be diagnosed and treated, often involving a cimbination of therapty, medication, and other supportive interventions.

It's important to note that mentall illness is common, treatable, and nothing to be ashamed of - just like any other health condition.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the widespread shift to remote work have significantly intensified mental health challenges within the technology sector. As isolation, blurred work-life boundaries, and increased screen time became the norm, tech professionals faced unprecedented levels of stress, anxiety, and burnout. Addressing these mental health concerns is not only crucial for individual well-being but also directly impacts organizational success, as better mental health correlates with enhanced productivity, creativity, and job satisfaction among employees. 

This project seeks to examine the behavioral patterns and mental health experiences of different groups within the tech industry, with the ultimate goal of identifying evidence-based solutions and interventions that can effectively improve mental health outcomes and foster a more supportive work environment for technology professionals.
